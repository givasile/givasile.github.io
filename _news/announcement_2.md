I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Multimedia Understanding
Group (MUG)](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/) from February of 2018 until
September of 2020. I was mainly involved in the Horizon-2020 research
project [BigO](https://bigoprogram.eu/), where my primary
responsibility was extracting users' daily activity and habits
(sleeping, sitting, walking etc.) from accelerometer and gyroscope
signals using machine learning and signal processing techniques.
