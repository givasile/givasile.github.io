Throughout my degree, I mainly focused on courses related to the fields of Machine Learning and Optimisation. In my dissertation, I was primarily involved in the area of Likelihood-free inference, where I implemented the [Robust Optimisation Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00670) at the python package [ELFI](https://elfi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Engine for Likelihood-Free Inference).

I completed my degree with distinction (78/100). [Here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/S1982285_113_10_2020_11_56_36.pdf) you can find the individual grades.
