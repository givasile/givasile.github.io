Throughout my degree, I mainly focused on courses related to the fields of Machine Learning. In my dissertation, I was primarily involved in the area of Computer Vision and especially in applying Deep Learning models for estimating the depth in stereo vision images.

I completed my degree with 7.56/10. [Here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/diploma_supplement_english.pdf) you can find the individual grades.
