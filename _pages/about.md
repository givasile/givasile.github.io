I am broadly interested in applying machine learning for solving a wide range of problems.

◆ Currently working as Research Assistant at [ATHENA Research and Innovation Center](https://www.athena-innovation.gr/)

◍ Main research interests include (a) simulator-based (likelihood-free) inference models and (b) Deep Learning mainly for solving image problems 

◉ I actively contribute to open-source project [ELFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi), where I have implemented the [ROMC]({{ site.url }}/dissertations/2_thesis_UoE/) method

✸ I completed my MSc in Data Science at 2020 (78/100, Distinction), University of Edinburgh
