I am broadly interested in applying machine learning techniques for solving a wide range of problems.

I completed my diploma in electrical and computer engineering at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in November 2017. Throughout my thesis, I mainly focused on machine learning with applications in computer vision. Afterwards, I worked as a research associate in the EU-funded project BigO, as member of the MUG group. At September of 2020, I completed my MSc in Operational Research with Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, with distinction. My dissertation there concentrated in the fields of Probabilistic Machine Learning and specifically likelihood-free inference techniques.
